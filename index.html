                            Complex Automated Negotiations have been widely studied and are one of the emerging areas of research in the field of Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems. 
                            These days AI systems have been developed by many different companies and organizations. 
                            In the near future, if a lot of heterogeneous AI systems are acting in a society, 
                            then we do need to have coordination mechanisms based on automated negotiation technologies. 
                            It must be complex and also autonomous because of the complexity of our society.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The complexity in an automated negotiation depends on several factors: 
                            the number of negotiated issues, dependencies between these issues, representation of the utility, negotiation procedural and protocol, negotiation form (bilateral or multi-party), time constraints negotiation goals, and so on. 
                            Complex automated negotiation scenarios are concerned with negotiation encounters where we may have for instance, 
                            a large number of agents, a large number of issues with strong interdependencies, real time constraints, concurrent and inter-depended negotiation, and etc. 
                            Many real world negotiation scenarios present one or more of the mentioned elements. 
                            Software agents can support the automation of complex negotiations, by negotiating on the behalf of their owners and providing adequate strategies to their owners to achieve realistic, win-win agreements. 
                            In order to provide solutions in such complex automated negotiation scenarios, research has focused on incorporating different technologies including search, CSP, graphical utility models, Bayesian nets, auctions, utility graphs, optimization and predicting and learning methods. 
                            The applications of complex automated negotiations could include e-commerce tools, decision-making support tools, negotiation support tools, collaboration tools, as well as knowledge discovery and agent learning tools.

                            A considerable number of researchers in various sub-communities of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems are actively working on these and related issues. 
                            They are, for instance, being studied in agent negotiations, multi-issue negotiations, auctions, mechanism design, electronic commerce, voting, secure protocols, matchmaking and brokering, argumentation, co-operation mechanisms and distributed optimization.

                        <p>
                            The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from these communities to learn about each other's approaches to the complex negotiation problems, 
                            encourages the exchange of ideas between the different areas, and potentially fosters long-term research collaborations to accelerate progress towards scaling up to larger and more realistic applications.

                            Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC) Special Session From 2010, ACAN is tightly cooperating with ANAC (Automated Negotiating Agents Competition). 
                            This year, we have an ANAC special session, in which we plan to explain and discuss the research challenges addressed in ANAC 2018.

                            Review Process and Acceptance Standards For gathering high quality papers, each paper needs to be reviewed by at least three PC members or experts in the field. Acceptance standards include its technical soundness, novelty, impact and readability. 
                            The same publication procedure as our previous workshops, we are planning to publish a Post-Workshop book for ACAN2018 in Books Series Studies in Computational Intelligence, by Springer. 
                            Also, we will assume that papers accepted should have full-paper quality with small revisions for special issue in a journal (International Journal of Multiagent and Grid Systems, Knowledge-Based Systems journal, Decision Support Systems Journal, and Group Decision and Negotiation Journal- are some possibilities).
